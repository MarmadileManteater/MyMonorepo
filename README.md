# my monorepo

This repository replaces [gh-pages-site-data](https://github.com/MarmadileManteater/gh-pages-site-data), [gh-static-site-lib](https://github.com/MarmadileManteater/gh-static-site-lib), [MySocialFeed](https://github.com/MarmadileManteater/MySocialFeed), and [SvelteKitSite](https://github.com/MarmadileManteater/SvelteKitSite). I tried for the git submodule thing. It was kind of weird, and then, I had a zillion CI workflows running each and every single day. This is probably better. At the very least, its more consolidated.
