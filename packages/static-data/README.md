# static data for my personal website

This repository contains all of the non-code assets for [my personal website](https://marmadilemanteater.dev).

[Mutant Standard](https://mutant.tech/) emoji by [Dzuk](https://dzuk.zone/), are licensed under [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).

I have not made any alterations to either of them. This repository simply acts as a way to pull all of these images in as a git submodule.

Both of these emoji are included in this repository because I wanted my websites to support all emoji in the Unicode 14.0, and while Mutant Standard provides a [â™¥lovely collection of custom emoji](https://mutant-cheat-sheet.netlify.app/), my goal was to use these like a font. I wanted something that I could just throw on top of my existing code, and at the end of the day, I could always remove, and just go back to serving plain jane ðŸ‘©emoji.
